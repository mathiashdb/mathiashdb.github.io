  abstract = {Mitigating the energy use in buildings, together with satisfaction of comfort requirements are the main objectives of efficient building control systems. Augmenting building energy systems with batteries can improve the energy use of a building, while posing the challenge of considering battery degradation during control operation. We demonstrate the performance of a data-enabled predictive control (DeePC) approach applied to a single multizone building and an energy hub comprising an electric heat pump and a battery. In a comparison with a standard rule-based controller, results demonstrate that the performance of DeePC is superior in terms of satisfaction of comfort constraints without increasing grid power consumption. Moreover, DeePC achieved two-fold decrease in battery degradation over one year, as compared to a rule-based controller.},

Inspired by the feedback optimization paradigm, the core idea of the proposed approach is to re-purpose classic iterative algorithms for solving generalized equations (e.g., Josephy–Newton, forward-backward splitting) as dynamic feedback controllers by integrating online measurements of the continuous-time nonlinear plant. Sufficient conditions for closed-loop stability and robustness of the algorithm-plant cyberphysical interconnection are derived in a sampled-data setting by combining and tailoring results from (monotone) operator, fixed-point, and nonlinear systems theory.

Efficiency is encoded using generalized equations which can model a broad spectrum of useful objectives, such as optimality or equilibria (e.g. Nash, Wardrop, etc.) in noncooperative games. The core idea of the proposed approach is to directly implement iterative solution (or equilibrium seeking) algorithms in closed loop with physical systems.

  abstract = {In distributed model predictive control (MPC), the control input at each sampling time is computed by solving a large-scale optimal control problem (OCP) over a finite horizon using distributed algorithms. Typically, such algorithms require several (virtually, infinite) communication rounds between the subsystems to converge, which is a major drawback both computationally and from an energetic perspective (for wireless systems). Motivated by these challenges, we propose a suboptimal distributed MPC scheme in which the total communication burden is distributed also in time, by maintaining a running solution estimate for the largescale OCP and updating it at each sampling time. We demonstrate that, under some regularity conditions, the resulting suboptimal MPC control law recovers the qualitative robust stability properties of optimal MPC, if the communication budget at each sampling time is large enough.},

  abstract = {Because physics-based building models are difficult to obtain as each building is individual, there is an increasing interest in generating models suitable for building MPC directly from measurement data. Machine learning methods have been widely applied to this problem and validated mostly in simulation; there are, however, few studies on a direct comparison of different models or validation in real buildings to be found in the literature. Methods that are indeed validated in application often lead to computationally complex non-convex optimization problems. Here we compare physics-informed Autoregressive–Moving-Average with Exogenous Inputs (ARMAX) models to Machine Learning models based on Random Forests and Input Convex Neural Networks and the resulting convex MPC schemes in experiments on a practical building application with the goal of minimizing energy consumption while maintaining occupant comfort, and in a numerical case study. The building has a water-based emission system and is located in temperate climate. We demonstrate that Predictive Control leads to savings between 26\% and 49\% of heating and cooling energy, compared to the building’s baseline hysteresis controller. Moreover, we show that all model types lead to satisfactory control performance in terms of constraint satisfaction and energy reduction. However, we also see that the physics-informed ARMAX models have a lower computational burden, and a superior sample efficiency compared to the Machine Learning based models. Moreover, even if abundant training data is available, the ARMAX models have a significantly lower prediction error than the Machine Learning models, which indicates that the encoded physics-based prior of the former cannot independently be found by the latter.},

A promising strategy is ergodic trajectory planning, whereby an agent spends in each area a fraction of time which is proportional to its probability information density function. In this paper, a decentralized ergodic multi-agent trajectory planning algorithm featuring limited communication constraints is proposed. The agents’ trajectories are designed by optimizing a weighted cost encompassing ergodicity, control energy and close-distance operation objectives. To solve the underlying optimal control problem, a second-order descent iterative method coupled with a projection operator in the form of an optimal feedback controller is used. Exhaustive numerical analyses show that the multi-agent solution allows a much more efficient exploration in terms of completion task time and control energy distribution by leveraging collaboration among agents.},

The proposed algorithm uses both absolute and relative pose measurements between neighbouring satellites in a network, allowing each individual satellite to estimate its own pose and that of its neighbours. By utilizing the distributed Kalman consensus filter, a novel sensor and state-estimate fusion procedure is proposed that allows each satellite to improve its own state estimate by sharing data with its neighbours over a communication link. A leader-follower approach, whereby only a subset of the satellites have access to an absolute pose measurement is also examined. In this case, followers rely solely on the information provided by their neighbours, as well as relative pose measurements to those neighbours. The algorithm is tested extensively via numerical simulations, and it is shown that the approach provides a substantial improvement in performance over the scenario in which the satellites do not cooperate. A case study of satellites swarming an asteroid is presented, and the performance in the leader-follower scenario is also analyzed.},

Such systems are highly nonlinear, and a cohesive strategy for their control is lacking in the literature. In this paper, we present two techniques pertaining to the density control of such systems. Agent states are initially distributed according to some density, and a feedback law is designed to move the agents to a target density profile. We use optimal mass transport to design a feedforward control law propelling the agents towards this target density. Kernel density estimation, with constraints imposed by the state-dependent dynamics, is then used to allow each agent to estimate the local density of the agents.},

We discuss a method of remediating these radiation belts first proposed by Danilov and Vasilyev, and recently improved by Hoyt, Minor, and Cash, where a long, charged tether is placed in orbit inside a radiation belt. In this approach, an electric field of the tether scatters the belt particles into a pitch angle loss cone leading to absorption of the particles in the atmosphere. A test particle calculation is presented which computes the scattered pitch angle of belt particles as a function of initial pitch angle and gyrophase for different particle energies. The moments of the resulting distribution of scattered angle versus initial pitch angle are used to compute the number density of the belt as a function of time using a Fokker-Planck diffusion approximation. Finally, we use the characteristic timescales of scattering for particles of different energies to discuss the feasibility of using such a system of tethers as a long and short-term remediation solution.},

  abstract = {Model predictive control (MPC) strategies can be applied to the coordination of energy hubs to reduce their energy consumption. Despite the effectiveness of these techniques, their potential for energy savings are potentially underutilized due to the fact that energy demands are often assumed to be fixed quantities rather than controlled dynamic variables. The joint optimization of energy hubs and buildings’ energy management systems can result in higher energy savings. This paper investigates how different MPC strategies perform on energy management systems in buildings and energy hubs. We first discuss two MPC approaches; centralized and decentralized. While the centralized control strategy offers optimal performance, its implementation is computationally prohibitive and raises privacy concerns. On the other hand, the decentralized control approach, which offers ease of implementation, displays significantly lower performance. We propose a third strategy, distributed control based on dual decomposition, which has the advantages of both approaches. Numerical case studies and comparisons demonstrate that the performance of distributed control is close to the performance of the centralized case, while maintaining a significantly lower computational burden, especially in large-scale scenarios with many agents. Finally, we validate and verify the reliability of the proposed method through an experiment on a full-scale energy hub system in the NEST demonstrator in Dübendorf, Switzerland.},

Here, by exploiting the precision and flexibility of nanoelectromechanical systems, we examined the dynamics of a ring of quasi-sinusoidal oscillators at and beyond first order. Beyond first order, we found exotic states of synchronization with highly complex dynamics, including weak chimeras, decoupled states, traveling waves, and inhomogeneous synchronized states. Through theory and experiment, we show that these exotic states rely on complex interactions emerging out of networks with simple linear nearest-neighbor coupling. This work provides insight into the dynamical richness of complex systems with weak nonlinearities and local interactions.},

  abstract = {We consider the properties of protoplanetary discs that are undergoing inside-out clearing by photoevaporation. In particular, we aim to characterize the conditions under which a protoplanetary disc may undergo ‘thermal sweeping’, a rapid ( 104 years) disc destruction mechanism proposed to occur when a clearing disc reaches sufficiently low surface density at its inner edge and where the disc is unstable to runaway penetration by the X-rays. We use a large suite of 1D radiation-hydrodynamic simulations to probe the observable parameter space, which is unfeasible in higher dimensions. These models allow us to determine the surface density at which thermal sweeping will take over the disc’s evolution and to evaluate this critical surface density as a function of X-ray luminosity, stellar mass and inner hole radius. We find that this critical surface density scales linearly with X-ray luminosity, increases with inner hole radius and decreases with stellar mass, and we develop an analytic model that reproduces these results. This surface density criterion is then used to determine the evolutionary state of protoplanetary discs at the point that they become unstable to destruction by thermal sweeping. We find that transition discs created by photoevaporation will undergo thermal sweeping when their inner holes reach 20–40 au, implying that transition discs with large holes and no accretion (which were previously a predicted outcome of the later stages of all flavours of the photoevaporation model) will not form. Thermal sweeping thus avoids the production of large numbers of large, non-accreting holes (which are not observed) and implies that the majority of holes created by photoevaporation should still be accreting. We emphasize that the surface density criteria that we have developed apply to all situations where the disc develops an inner hole that is optically thin to X-rays. It thus applies not only to the case of holes originally created by photoevaporation but also to holes formed, for example, by the tidal influence of planets.},

This problem involves jointly adapting the locations of active sensors and actuators in the network and the feedback control policy to all available information about the time-varying network state and dynamics to optimize a performance criterion. We propose a general solution structure analogous to the classical self-tuning regulator from adaptive control. We show that a special case with full-state feedback can be solved in principle with dynamic programming, and in the linear quadratic setting the optimal cost functions and policies are piecewise quadratic and piecewise linear, respectively. For large networks where exhaustive architecture search is prohibitive, we describe a greedy heuristic for joint architecture-policy design. We demonstrate in numerical experiments that self-tuning architectures can provide dramatically improved performance over fixed architectures. Our general formulation provides an extremely rich and challenging problem space with opportunities to apply a wide variety of approximation methods from stochastic control, system identification, reinforcement learning, and static architecture design.},

Finally, we provide a sufficient condition on the topological structure of the specified formation to guarantee convergence of the swarm in formation around the target location.},

  abstract = {Data-enabled predictive control (DeePC) has emerged as a powerful technique to control complex systems without the need for extensive modeling efforts. However, relying solely on offline collected data trajectories to represent the system dynamics introduces certain drawbacks. Therefore, we present a novel semi-data-driven model predictive control (SDMPC) framework that combines (limited) model information with DeePC to address a range of these drawbacks, including sensitivity to noisy data, lack of robustness, and a high computational burden. In this work we focus on the performance of DeePC in operating regimes not captured by the offline collected data trajectories and demonstrate how incorporating an underlying parametric model can counteract this issue. SDMPC exhibits equivalent closed-loop performance as DeePC for deterministic linear time-invariant systems. Simulations demonstrate the general control performance of the proposed SD-MPC for both a linear time-invariant system and a nonlinear system modeled as a linear parameter-varying system. These results provide numerical evidence of the enhanced robustness of SDMPC over classical DeePC.},
